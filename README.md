**TMDB Stand Alone Flask App**
```
This is a simple Flask web application that interacts with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to display:
	•The most popular movies sorted by vote count.
	•The most popular actors, sorted by the number of movies they’ve appeared in.

1. Features
	•/popular-movies — Lists popular movies sorted by number of votes.
	•/top-actors — Lists popular actors sorted by how many movies they’ve acted in. Supports pagination via query parameter actors_per_page.

2. Requirements
	•Python 3.7+
	•Flask
	•requests
	•pandas

3. How to Run
	1.Code into a Python file (e.g., app.py).
	2.Make sure you have Python installed and dependencies installed.
	3.Run the app: python3 app.py
	The server will start at: http://localhost:8080

4. Endpoints
	/popular-movies
	•Method: GET
	•Description: Returns an HTML page listing popular movies and their vote counts.
	•Example: http://localhost:8080/popular-movies

	/top-actors
	•Method: GET
	•Description: Returns an HTML page listing popular actors and how many movies they’ve appeared in.
	•Query Parameter:
	•actors_per_page (optional): Number of actors per page (default is 20). Pagination is handled manually for /top-actors, but the output is combined into a single HTML page.
	•Example: http://localhost:8080/top-actors?actors_per_page=10
```

**Docker Setup**
Docker helps to containarise and run application wiht all dependencies and can be shipped to any machine.
```
1. Prerequisites
	•Make sure Docker is installed on your system.
2. Project Structure
Your project directory should look like this:
        .
	├── app.py
	├── requirements.txt
	└── Dockerfile```
4. Build the Docker Image: 
   docker build -t tmdb-flask-app .
5. Run the Container:  
   docker run -p 8080:8080 tmdb-flask-app
6. Visit app at http://localhost:8080/top-actors
```

**GitHub Workflow: docker-build.yml**
```
Why Workflow ?

Although I can run this Flask app manually or inside a Docker container on my local machine, I created this GitHub Actions workflow for a few key reasons:

Automation & Consistency
By using a workflow, I ensure that every time I push to the main branch:
	•The app is built inside a Docker container
	•The container is run
	•The /top-actors endpoint is tested for availability
This eliminates human error and guarantees that each deployment or update passes a basic functionality check.

Quick Feedback Loop
Instead of manually spinning things up to verify changes, this workflow automatically tests that the app starts up and responds correctly. If something breaks, I get feedback immediately after a push.

Why a Self-Hosted Runner?
I chose a self-hosted runner for a few reasons:
	•I needed access to resources or configurations that GitHub-hosted runners don’t allow (run on my local host to test the webapp).
	•I wanted more control over the environment and caching to reduce cold starts.

What This Workflow Does
Here’s what the docker-build.yml workflow accomplishes:
	1.Checks out the code
	2.Sets up Docker Buildx (for advanced Docker builds)
	3.Builds the Docker image tagged my-flask-app
	4.Runs the container, mapping port 8080
	5.Waits for the app to start up (simple sleep command)
	6.Tests the app using a curl call to ensure /top-actors responds successfully
        7.It does not stop the container as I want it to run so we can test.
```
Use the below runner config from the repo to setup a self-hosted runner:
```
Create a Directory for the Runner - mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner 
Download the Latest Runner Package - curl -o actions-runner.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/latest/download/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.308.0.tar.gz 
Extract the Installer - tar xzf ./actions-runner.tar.gz 
Configure the Runner - ./config.sh --url https://github.com/Sonal0808/tmdb_assessment --token BREWOER55SJ4M6BNXHIQNCDH6LPKK 
Start the Runner - ./run.sh
```
